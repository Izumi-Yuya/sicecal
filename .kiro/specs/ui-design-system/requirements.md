# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a consistent UI design system across the Shise-Cal facility management application. The design system will establish visual consistency, improve user experience, and ensure intuitive navigation patterns throughout the application. Based on the provided design mockups, the system needs standardized components, layouts, and interaction patterns that maintain visual hierarchy and user flow clarity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the facility management system, I want consistent visual design patterns across all pages, so that I can navigate the application intuitively and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates between different pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent header, navigation, and layout patterns
2. WHEN a user views any form or data entry screen THEN the system SHALL use standardized input field styling, spacing, and validation feedback
3. WHEN a user interacts with buttons and controls THEN the system SHALL provide consistent visual feedback and styling across all components
4. WHEN a user views data tables or lists THEN the system SHALL apply uniform styling for headers, rows, and interactive elements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user reviewing facility information, I want clear visual hierarchy and information organization, so that I can quickly find and understand the data I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views facility details THEN the system SHALL organize information using consistent card layouts with clear section headers
2. WHEN a user scans information sections THEN the system SHALL use standardized typography hierarchy with consistent font sizes, weights, and spacing
3. WHEN a user needs to distinguish between different types of information THEN the system SHALL use consistent color coding and visual grouping
4. WHEN a user views tabbed content THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent tab styling and content organization patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user working with forms and data entry, I want intuitive input controls and clear feedback, so that I can complete tasks efficiently without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user fills out forms THEN the system SHALL provide consistent input field styling with clear labels and placeholder text
2. WHEN a user encounters validation errors THEN the system SHALL display standardized error messages with consistent styling and positioning
3. WHEN a user interacts with dropdown menus and selectors THEN the system SHALL use uniform styling and behavior patterns
4. WHEN a user needs to save or submit data THEN the system SHALL provide consistent button styling and loading states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user navigating the application, I want clear visual indicators and feedback, so that I always understand my current location and available actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any page THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the current page location using consistent breadcrumb or navigation highlighting
2. WHEN a user hovers over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide consistent hover states and visual feedback
3. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and success/error feedback using standardized components
4. WHEN a user views status information THEN the system SHALL use consistent status indicators, badges, and color coding

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user accessing the system on different devices, I want the interface to remain usable and visually consistent, so that I can work effectively regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the system on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain usable layouts with appropriate touch targets and spacing
2. WHEN a user resizes their browser window THEN the system SHALL adapt layouts gracefully while maintaining visual consistency
3. WHEN a user views data tables on smaller screens THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate responsive behavior (scrolling, stacking, or collapsing)
4. WHEN a user navigates on touch devices THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements are appropriately sized and spaced

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want reusable UI components and clear design guidelines, so that I can implement new features consistently and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new features THEN developers SHALL have access to standardized component templates and styling guidelines
2. WHEN creating forms THEN developers SHALL use consistent validation patterns and error handling approaches
3. WHEN adding new pages THEN developers SHALL follow established layout patterns and navigation structures
4. WHEN styling components THEN developers SHALL use centralized CSS/SCSS variables for colors, spacing, and typography
